# Employee Performance Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview (Designed for Beginners)

This project originated from a data analysis session specifically designed for **beginners and non-technical profiles**. Our objective was twofold:

1.  **Pedagogy:** To demonstrate, with numbers, how to transform raw data ($\mathbf{100,000}$ records) into actionable strategic directives.
2.  **Structure:** To use the HR dataset variables to simulate and better understand the **architecture and management challenges of an organization** (like our GDG Club).

## 📁 Repository Structure

| Folder/File | Role | Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`notebook/`** | Main Analysis (Code) | Contains the `GDG-Analysis-session.ipynb` with the full step-by-step analysis. |
| **`data/`** | Source Dataset | Contains the `Extended_Employee_Performance_and_Productivity_Data.csv` (Source: CC0 license from Kaggle). |
| **`presentation.ppt`** | Session Slides | The PowerPoint used to deliver the session's content. |
| **`report.pdf`** | Strategic Report | The final executive document with data-driven recommendations. |
| **`requirements.txt`** | Python Dependencies | List of libraries needed to run the Notebook. |
| **`README.md`** | Documentation | The document you are currently reading (Strategic Summary). |

## 🎯 STRATEGIC SUMMARY: Key Data Directives

**(This summary presents the immediate actions required to optimize the work environment and service/product quality.)**

| Strategic Area | Quantitative Finding | Action Directive |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Work Efficiency** | Performance: **2.9** (35-40h) vs. **3.0** (>45h). | **ACTION:** Stop measuring time. The negligible gain proves efficiency is key. **MAXIMIZE** output in the optimal 35-40h range. |
| **2. Flexibility** | Remote Work: **3.0** vs. Office: **2.9**. | **ACTION:** Formalize the **"Results-Based Flexible Work"** model to attract top talent and reduce infrastructure costs. |
| **3. Engagement Risk** | $\mathbf{24.9\%}$ of employees are **"Neutral"** (Score 3). | **URGENCY:** Deploy **targeted qualitative surveys** to convert this $\mathbf{24.9\%}$ risk group into engaged staff and improve the work environment. |
| **4. Talent Stability** | $\mathbf{53.8\%}$ is the stable core vs. $\mathbf{20.5\%}$ young talent. | **ACTION:** Implement a **Reciprocal Mentorship Program** to secure knowledge and provide clear career paths. |
| **5. Structural Capacity** | Support Functions (HR/Engineering) are **11%** each. | **ACTION:** Prioritize investment in **technology and training** for these critical $\mathbf{11\%}$ teams to guarantee sustained service/product quality. |
